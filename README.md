Sebo Dev Base Theme
===================

This is the starter theme for Sebo Dev custom projects. It's a fork of [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s)

It's been gulpified and sassified for optimal workflow.

It requires that you have `node` and `npm` installed.

We are also using `ruby-sass` so you'll need to have `ruby` and the `sass` gem installed.

If you're working with a local site you can set a proxy url for browser-sync in `gulpfile.js`

To get things started you'll can run `npm start`. This will install all of our npm packages and bower components.

After that you can run a gulp task and you're off to the races.
